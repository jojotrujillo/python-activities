            Yes, my name is Jordon. I live and work here in Omaha. I'm almost thirty years old, and I'm single with
                no children. I stay out of trouble and try to keep busy. This will be my fourth year of higher
                education, although I'm not following the typical timeline. I'm only taking one course per semester,
                so we're looking at graduating around Summer of 2022. Currently, I'm interning at Kiewit Corporation.
                A month ago I was working as an IT Coordinator at a small distribution company over by Eppley
                Airfield. I'm extremely blessed to have secured the internship at Kiewit because I get to work
                alongside my father and brother. My main job duty is learning how to develop SAP applications. I'm
                learning ABAP and practicing a lot of Agile methods. I'm excited to begin this course and I'm looking
                forward to learning more about Python and Django!
